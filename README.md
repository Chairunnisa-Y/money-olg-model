# Money in Overlapping-Generations Models

This repository contains personal lecture notes and mathematical derivations on the role of money as a medium of exchange and store of value within overlapping-generations (OLG) models.

The materials are primarily based on Heijdra (2023), Chapter 10, and focus on intertemporal consumption, liquidity constraints, and the choice between holding money and capital assets.

## Scope

The repository documents:
- The basic structure of the OLG model
- Budget constraints for young and old agents
- Consumption–saving decisions with money and capital
- Analytical derivations supporting economic intuition

All notes are independently written and intended for learning, presentation, and academic discussion purposes.

## Project Status

This repository is a final report that just submitted after a faculty grading.

## Disclaimer

These materials are personal study notes and do not reproduce textbook content verbatim. They are not intended for commercial use.
